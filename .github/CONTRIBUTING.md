## How you can contribute

### Bug reports

When you think you might've experienced a bug, first search through the [issues](https://github.com/ts-docs/ts-docs/issues) to see if it has already been reported, if it hasn't, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/ts-docs/ts-docs/issues) which describes the bug in detail. Do not be afraid to give as much information as possible, and make sure to provide an example which replicates the bug in question.

- Make sure the name of your issue is clear and descriptive, avoid one-word issue names.
- Add the options you ran ts-docs with.


### Suggestions

If you have a suggestion, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/ts-docs/ts-docs/issues) describing the suggestion and the problems / issues it'll 
resolve. 

Suggestions which change the structure of the generated docs will be declined. If you would like a different structure, consider using [ts-extractor](https://github.com/ts-docs/ts-extractor) and generate the documentation yourself, or use an alternative to ts-docs, such as [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/).
