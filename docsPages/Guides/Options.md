# Options

You can provide options for ts-docs in three ways:

- The CLI
- `tsdocsOptions` property in your typescript configuration file.
- `tsdocs.config.js` file, which must export an object with the options. You can generate this file with the `--init` flag.

ts-docs first gets all CLI arguments, then combines them with the options from the typescript configuration, and finally with the `tsdocs.config.js` file. 

``` --CLI
ts-docs ./entry/point.js --out ./docs
```
```json --tsconfig.json
"tsdocsOptions": {
    "entryPoints": ["./entry/point.js"],
    "out": "./docs"
}
```
```js --tsdocs.config.js
module.exports = {
    entryPoints: ["./entry/point.js"],
    out: "./docs"
}
```

## List of options

To check out all the default options in one place, see the [[ts-docs/options]] constant.

### entryPoints

The entry points of all projects you want to be included in the documentation. Every project should have exactly one entry point, and the **order** matters. If package A relies on package B, but package A is specified first, then you'll see some of package B's modules being inside of package A. This will be fixed in the future, but for now, **the order matters**.

### structure

Which documentation structure to use. You should only provide the **name** of the documentation structure, ts-docs expects it to be located inside your `node_modules` folder. ts-docs doesn't come with any documentation structures, but the default of this option is `default-docs-structure`. To install the default structure use the following command:

```
npm i --save-dev @ts-docs/default-docs-structure
```

### landingPage

If your project is a monorepo, you can use this option to tell ts-docs which repository to use the README, version and name of for the landing page. The first provided entry point is used by default. 

### name

The name of the project that appears in the sidebar. Name of first provided entry point is by default.

### out

Where to generate the files. This option is set to `./docs` by default.

### json

ts-docs will create a json file at the given path with all the project data which it uses to create the documentation, instead of actually creating the documentation.

### customPages

A path to a directory of custom pages. Inside that folder, each inner-folder is a category and each file inside that folder is a custom page.

### assets

A path to a folder with assets with additional assets for the docs. It will copy all files and folders inside that folder and paste them inside the generated `./assets` folder.

### logo

A logo to use. It MUST be inside the folder provided to the `assets` option. The logo will be placed in the sidebar, below the name. 

### externals

An array of extenal libs. This option can only be supplied with the `tsdocs.config.js` file. To read more about external libraries and how to set them up, go [here](https://ts-docs.github.io/ts-docs/pages/Guides/Externals.html) 

### passthroughModules

If for some reason you don't want a specific folder to become a module, include the name of the folder it in the `passthroughModules` array. All the things inside that folder will be in the **parent** module. 

### branches

You can also document future (or previous) stable versions of your project using the `branches` option. When the option is provided, a "Branches" section is added to the left of the index page, where you can switch between other branches of your project.

ts-docs will use the same options to generate the different branches, except for `landingPage` - you have to specify the landing page yourself.

Here's how the option looks:

```js
{
    entryPoints: ["./project-a/src/index"],
    branches: [
        {
            displayName: "next", // The name of the branch that will be displayed, can be anything you want
            landingPage: "project-a", // The landing page of that branch
            branches: [ // The ACTUAL branches that will be included
                {
                    name: "dev", // The name of the branch
                    entryPoint: "./src/index", // The entry point of the project, relative to the root directory of the project
                    project: "project-a" // The name of the project (the name in package.json)
                },
                {
                    name: "main",
                    entryPoint: "./src/index",
                    external: "https://github.com/ts-docs/ts-extractor" // Link to the repository
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
}
```

The `branches` property should be an array of [[BranchOption]]. Use the [[BranchOption.project]] property if the branch is part of a project that is inside your [[TsDocsOptions.entryPoints]] option, otherwise, use the [[BranchOption.external]] option with a link to the repository.


### changelog

If this option is enabled, a changelog will be generated. ts-docs will attempt to get the latest release in the **repository of the landing page**.

### forceEmit

To make the generation process faster, ts-docs will save the last time your files were modified, and the next time you want to generate documentation, ts-docs will skip untouched files. Turning on this option will always make it so new documentation is generated.

### tsconfig

Path to a `tsconfig.json` file to use for the typescript compiler. The ts-docs extractor works best with a specific set of options, so if for some reason the docs you're getting are messed up, either provide a path to your project's `tsconfig.json` file, or pass `"none"`, which will pick the best compiler options to use.

### exportMode

How should exports be displayed.

- `simple` - Only the names of all the exported elements from the `index.ts` file are shown. If the module doesn't have an `index.ts` file, then no exports are shown. 
- `detailed` - The exports from every file in the module are shown separately. 

The default option is set to `simple`.

### stripInternal

Removes all internal items from the generated documentation, **but** it keeps references around. This option is inherited from the `stripInternal` option in your `tsconfig.json` file. (You may have to point ts-docs to your `tsconfig.json` file via the `tsconfig` option.)

### sort

How to sort items (classes, interfaces, enums, functions, constants, types, methods, properties, enum members)

- `source` - How they were found in the source code, this is the default option
- `alphabetical`

### docTests

Transpiles and runs typescript and javascript code inside function / method documentation comments. This option only works when there is a single output directory. Check out the [Documentation Tests](./Documentation Tests) guide for more information.
